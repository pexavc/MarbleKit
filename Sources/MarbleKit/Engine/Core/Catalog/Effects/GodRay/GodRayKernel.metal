// I realized, after a while, that determining the correct light position doesn't help, since
// radial blur doesn't really look right unless its focus point is within the screen boundaries,
// whereas the light is often out of frame. Therefore, I decided to go for something that at
// least gives the feel of following the light. In this case, I normalized the light position
// and rotated it in unison with the camera rotation. Hacky, for sure, but who's checking? :)
